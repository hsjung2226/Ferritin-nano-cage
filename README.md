Title: Development of a ferritin-based nanocage vaccine consisting of the
tPspAantigen andFlaBadjuvant(Ftn-tPspA-FlaBnanocage: FPB NC)using the
SpyTag-SpyCatcher system. 

Summary:A Schematic representation of the strategy for
developing the FPB nanocage vaccine. This diagram provides a visual representa
tion of the plasmid constructs. It simulates the protein structure of the critical
components of the ferritin-tPspA-FlaB nanocage (FPB NC): SpyTag-ferritin, Spy
Catcher-tPspA, and SpyCatcher-FlaB. The depicted DNA fragments correspond to
essential elements of the constructs representing ΔN1-SpyCatcher (SC, cyan),
SpyTag (ST, violet), truncated PspA (tPspA; amino acid 3-236, red), FlaB (green),
